Thank you for being conscientious."

You will also receive an extra $5 thank you on each of the two dates. Payments will be Amazon gift cards emailed to the address you submitted. Your total across the two dates will be between $15 and $20. The gift cards will be sent on the day in question. If the line selected for you includes todayâ€™s date, you will receive a gift card today. We have made all promised payments to earlier participants. Thank you for your time."
